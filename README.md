# Car Prediction Model

## Introduction

The Car Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to predict car prices based on various features. By leveraging data such as mileage, engine size, and more, this model provides accurate price estimates, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. A web application has been developed using Flask to make the model accessible to users.

## Machine Learning

### **Importing Libraries**

Start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Key libraries include:
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Flask**: For developing the web application interface.

### **Understanding Data with Descriptive Statistics**

Use descriptive statistics to understand the basic characteristics of the data. This includes:
- **Summary Statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.
- **Data Distribution**: Histograms and box plots to visualize feature distributions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To identify relationships between features and the target variable.

### **Data Preparation**

Prepare the data for modeling by performing the following steps:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing values as necessary.
- **Feature Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- **Normalization/Scaling**: Standardize or normalize numerical features to improve model performance.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain deeper insights into the dataset:
- **Visualization**: Create plots to explore feature relationships and distributions.
- **Patterns and Trends**: Identify any patterns or trends that may influence the target variable.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detect and address outliers that could affect the model’s performance.

### **Feature Selection**

Select the most relevant features for the model:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Assess the correlation between features and the target variable.
- **Feature Importance**: Use techniques such as feature importance scores or recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify key features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if needed to reduce feature dimensionality.

### **Model Building**

Build and train the predictive model:
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
- **Model Training**: Train the model on the prepared dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters.

### **Final Model Selection**

Evaluate and select the best-performing model:
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) to assess model performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare different models and select the one that performs best based on evaluation metrics.

## Data Sources

The data for the model comes from:
- **Car Listings**: Data from online platforms and dealerships.
- **Automotive Databases**: Public datasets with historical price and feature information.
- **User Data**: Data collected from surveys or user submissions.

## Data Visualization

Visualization helps in understanding and validating the model:
- **Feature Distributions**: Histograms and box plots.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: To analyze relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Model Performance**: Plots of predicted vs. actual prices, residual plots, and learning curves.

## Use of Technology
